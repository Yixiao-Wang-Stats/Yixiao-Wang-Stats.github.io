## ACADEMIC PROJECTS
---
### Trimmed Mean for Partially Observed Functional Data | Bachelor’s Thesis  
_Supervised by Associate Professor Lan Xiaohong from USTC._  
- Defined the trimmed mean for partially observed functional data.
- Proved consistent convergence of the estimator and conducted numerical simulations.
- The thesis is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13062), and the code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Yixiao-Wang-Stats/TMoPOFD).

### LSTM-GRU Hybrid Network | Course Project for Time Series Analysis  
_Feb. 2024-Mar. 2024_  
- Cleaned and preprocessed the PM2.5 pollution data from Chengdu.
- Proposed an LSTM-GRU hybrid network architecture, inspired by GoogLeNet, for PM2.5 time series forecasting, which reduced the error rate by 30% compared to LSTM.
- The essay is available [here](https://yixiao-wang-stats.github.io/files/LSTMGRU.pdf), and the code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Yixiao-Wang-Stats/LSTM-GRU-Hybrid-Network).
