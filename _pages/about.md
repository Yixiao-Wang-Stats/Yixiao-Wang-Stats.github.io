Yixiao Wang
======
Originally from China, I came to the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) to study Mathematics and Statistics at [School of Gifted Young](https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/). I am currently a first-year master student in the [Statistics Department at Duke University](https://stat.duke.edu/). My research interests include machine learning theory, functional data analysis, and their applications. At USTC, I particularly enjoyed my time as a teaching assistant for *[Linear Algebra B1](https://yixiao-wang-stats.github.io/teaching/2023-Spring-MATH1009-Linear-Algebra-B1)*, as it provided me with the opportunity to teach students directly, and I was recognized as one of the best TAs at USTC. In my free time, I enjoy creating generative art, especially origami, and listening to music.
