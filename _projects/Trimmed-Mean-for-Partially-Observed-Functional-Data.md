My presentation primarily focused on random matrices, particularly using the Moment Method to prove:
- Wignerâ€™s Semicircle Law
- Marcenko-Pastur Law

 Generating a Second-Order Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE)
------
In the vedio below, we show how to generate a second-order Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) matrix. We visualize the process using the [Manim library](https://github.com/manimCommunity/manim).
